# Maps

This is a webpage that employs the Google Maps Javascript API. Its function is to use HTML5 Geolocation to get the location of the user and map it to a destination (in this case, hardcoded). Allows user to search for waypoints before reaching his/her destination using the search box. Search results will appear on the map. They can be viewed with a single click and selected as a waypoint with a double click. Clicking "Route!" will route the user from his/her initial location to destination, stopping on all waypoints selected. User can choose to bike, drive, walk, or use public transit to reach destination.
